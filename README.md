Polyglot: 
          The polyglot is a platform that provides an opportunity to practice communication in a preferred language by connecting, chatting, and speaking to people                 around the world at minimal pricing. It also offers audio rooms to enable speaking practice.  By searching the preferred language users can connect to the               people learning the same language and can practice their desired language with them.
